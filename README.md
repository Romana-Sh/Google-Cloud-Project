# Google-Cloud-Project


  deploy the Tutorials Django web app to the Google Cloud. 
  GCP services used in this workshop include: Cloud Run, Cloud Build, Cloud SQL, Artifact Registry, Secret Manager, and more.
   deploy the hello-google container at the end of this week. However, it is a more advanced version with the addition of provisioning an SQL server, setting up authentication using Secrets Manager, executing Django migrations commands in the running container, and more. 
    While the end result will be similar to the Tutorials app deployment using an AWS EC2 server, one major difference is that you will be using serverless platforms instead of provisioning a dedicated server.
use the gcloud CLI tool to set up and interact with the backing cloud services, rather than using the GUI web console interface.
